## Summary
Flooding in the lower districts has worsened after recent sewer blockages. The city’s chief engineer has sealed off a critical access point, claiming structural danger. In truth, something old and malignant stirs beneath the city, poisoning the waters from a hidden spring. If left unchecked, the flooding and sickness will spread.

---

## Adventure Hooks
- Residents of the lower wards offer pooled coin to reopen the sewers.
- The party is hired to investigate why recent flood repairs have failed.
- A healer traces a rash of waterborne illness to the sewer outflows.

## Area Overview

**Location**  
The city’s main sewer artery slopes downward toward a natural underground spring. Cracked masonry, waist-deep water, and surging runoff make movement slow and dangerous.

**Occupants**  
The sewers are mostly abandoned, inhabited by vermin and one massive predator. The chief engineer controls surface access and is desperate to keep the truth hidden.

# Areas

<!-- ROOM 1 PURPOSE: The Threshold — social barrier and tone-setting -->

## 1. The Sealed Grate
A heavy iron grate blocks the main sewer entrance beneath a service arch. Lantern light reveals fresh locks and warning placards.

**Features**
- Reinforced iron grate
- Narrow maintenance alcove
- Constant sound of rushing water below

**Obstacle**
The **chief engineer** stands guard with two laborers. He insists the sewers are unsafe and claims orders from the city council.

- **Bribe:** He accepts payment or favors to look the other way.
- **Threaten:** He backs down if convinced the party can expose him.
- **Failure:** Forcing entry alerts him, leading to future political consequences.

**Escalation**
If negotiations turn hostile, floodgates in Area 2 are left improperly set.

<!-- ROOM 2 PURPOSE: The Tension — environmental hazard and resource drain -->

## 2. The Overflow Tunnels
Sloping tunnels carry runoff from multiple districts. Water rises and falls unpredictably.

**Features**
- Knee- to waist-deep water
- Slippery stone walkways
- Rusted control wheels

**Challenge**
Navigating the tunnels requires careful timing. Each delay risks rising water that can separate the party or sweep unsecured creatures off their feet.

**Information**
Scrape marks and cracked stone suggest something large has been moving through recently.

---

<!-- ROOM 3 PURPOSE: The Turn — reframes the threat -->

## 3. The Maintenance Sump
A wide chamber with broken tools, collapsed scaffolding, and foul-smelling sludge.

**Twist**
The flooding is not accidental. A natural spring has been intentionally obstructed to conceal something deeper below.

**Immediate Consequence**
Water pressure increases. If the obstruction is disturbed, the lower chambers begin slowly flooding.

---

<!-- ROOM 4 PURPOSE: The Confrontation — decisive encounter -->

## 4. The Blackflow Spring
A natural cavern opens around a dark spring. Stonework surrounds a partially submerged relic, its surface slick with black residue.

**Scene Features**
- Deep water surrounding the spring
- Slippery stone platforms
- Poor visibility below the surface

**Opposition**
A **Sewer Crocodilian** lurks beneath the water, attacking from concealment.

**Enemy Goal**
Defend its territory and drag prey into the spring.

**Outcomes**
- **Success:** The creature is slain or driven off.
- **Partial:** The party retrieves the relic but the creature escapes.
- **Failure:** The party is forced to retreat as flooding worsens.

---

<!-- ROOM 5 PURPOSE: The Echo — rewards and consequences -->

## 5. The Reliquary Ledge
A narrow stone shelf above the spring, carved with ancient symbols.

**Rewards**
- The corrupted relic (source of the poisoned water)
- Salvaged tools and records hidden by the engineer

**Consequences**
Removing the relic restores clean water but exposes the engineer’s cover-up.

**Unresolved Thread**
Who placed the relic here—and who else benefits from its influence?

---

## Scaling the Adventure
- **Lower Level:** Reduce water hazards; the crocodilian retreats at half HP.
- **Higher Level:** Add collapsing stone platforms during the final fight.
