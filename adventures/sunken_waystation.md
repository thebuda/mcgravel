## Summary
An Imperial waystation has collapsed into a flooded ravine, cutting off supply caravans. Something now nests below, and water levels continue to rise. If the route is not cleared within days, nearby settlements will face shortages.

---

## Adventure Hooks
- A merchant offers payment to reopen the road.
- Locals report lights moving beneath the collapsed bridge.
- The party needs supplies currently trapped beyond the ravine.

---

## Area Overview

**Location**
A stone waystation partially collapsed into a narrow ravine. Water pours through broken masonry, flooding the lower chambers.

**Occupants**
Displaced animals shelter below. They are aggressive but not intentionally hostile.

# Areas

<!-- ROOM 1 PURPOSE: The Threshold -->

## 1. The Collapsed Bridge
A broken stone bridge spans the ravine. Water surges beneath.

**Features**
- Narrow footing
- Slippery stone

**Obstacle**
A territorial **giant frog** lurks below, attacking creatures that disturb the water.

Failure to cross quietly alerts creatures in Area 3.

**Escalation**
Loud combat causes water levels to rise faster.

---

<!-- ROOM 2 PURPOSE: The Tension -->

## 2. The Floodgate Chamber
A rusted winch controls a floodgate embedded in the wall.

**Features**
- Jammed machinery
- Rising water

**Challenge**
Repairing or forcing the winch lowers water levels. Failure breaks the mechanism, permanently flooding Area 3.

**Information**
Scratched markings suggest the damage was deliberate.

---

<!-- ROOM 3 PURPOSE: The Turn -->

## 3. The Lower Hall
Collapsed stone and debris form makeshift nests.

**Twist**
The animals were driven here by poisoned water upstream.

**Immediate Consequence**
Disturbed creatures retreat toward Area 4 to escape.

---

<!-- ROOM 4 PURPOSE: The Confrontation -->

## 4. The Sinkhole Pool
A wide pool churns where the ravine narrows.

**Scene Features**
- Unstable footing
- Falling debris

**Opposition**
A **swarm of poisonous snakes** emerges from the water.

**Enemy Goal**
Escape the collapsing chamber.

**Outcomes**
- Success: The passage is cleared.
- Partial: Creatures flee; poison source remains.
- Failure: Flooding worsens, cutting off access.

---

<!-- ROOM 5 PURPOSE: The Echo -->

## 5. The Storehouse
A partially intact supply room above the floodline.

**Rewards**
Recovered supply manifests and an Imperial seal.

**Consequences**
The seal matches one used by a regional official.

**Unresolved Thread**
Who sabotaged the waystation—and why?

## Scaling the Adventure
- **Lower Level:** Replace swarm with single snake.
- **Higher Level:** Add collapsing ceiling hazard.
