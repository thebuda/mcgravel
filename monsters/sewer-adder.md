## At a glance
- **Role:** Striker
- **Threat:** Medium — poison spikes damage fast if the party clumps
- **Environment:** Old sewers, flooded tunnels, alchemical runoff zones
- **Signature:** Ambush bite backed by short-duration poison

## Tactics
- Hides in shallow water or debris and strikes the first creature to pass.
- Focuses attacks on lightly armored or already wounded targets.
- If reduced below half HP, it retreats into water or tight passages if possible.
- Fights to the death only if cornered or defending a nest.

## Encounter hooks
- Sewer workers have gone missing near a collapsed junction.
- Alchemical waste dumping has caused the local vermin to grow aggressive.
- A noble’s escaped experiment now infests the city’s underworks.

## Variants
- **Juvenile Adder:** Small size, HP 18, CR 1/2.
- **Spitting Adder:** Replace Bite poison with a 10-ft. poison spray (Dex save).
- **Alpha Sewer Adder:** HP 45, poison lasts 1 minute on failed save, CR 2.
