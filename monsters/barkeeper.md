## Barkeeper

A barkeeper is equal parts host, peacekeeper, and information broker. Years behind the bar have sharpened their tongue, their instincts, and their awareness of every chair, table, and doorway in the room.

When trouble starts, a barkeeper doesn’t panic—they lean on experience, familiarity, and a well-placed blade.

### Traits

**Master of the Bar.**  
While inside their own tavern or bar, the barkeeper has advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and opportunity attacks. In addition, difficult terrain caused by furniture does not slow the barkeeper’s movement.

**Disarming Presence.**  
The barkeeper has advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to calm hostile creatures that can hear them and are not already engaged in combat.

### Tactics

A barkeeper avoids fair fights. They move through tight spaces, use furniture as cover, and try to de-escalate before steel is drawn. If forced into combat, they strike quickly and look for an opening to escape or call for help.
